# Fast Matrix Multiplication That Does Not Slow Down

This is a talk I gave in Duke University on December 12, 2022.
During this time, ChatGPT was a thing so I decided to
formulate the slides as if I am asking ChatGPT to prepare a talk.

The talk is based on I and Duursma's preprint
*Parity-Checked Strassen Algorithm*
